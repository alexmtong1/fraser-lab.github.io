description: "Kara did her Bachelors in Biophysics at the George Washington University. Afterwards, she received a Fulbright Fellowship to work in [Henry Chapmanâ€™s lab](https://cid.cfel.de/team/henry_chapman/) at the Center for Free Electron Lasers in Hamburg, Germany, where she conducted many serial crystallography experiments. Next, she pursued a PhD in Biophysics at Cornell University under [Lois Pollack](https://www.engineering.cornell.edu/people/lois-pollack/). Her PhD work focused on developing time-resolved structural biology methods, especially bringing mix-and-inject serial crystallography to synchrotrons and performing time-resolved WAXS at XFELs. 

In the Fraser lab, Kara will study the substrate specificity of macrodomains. 

Outside of the lab, Kara likes trying new restaurants and keeping up with all things Taylor Swift."
